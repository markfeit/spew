I hope you will
Behold, thou shalt

Thou shalt

%HAVE_BAD_THINGS_HAPPEN 
have more mother-in-laws than King Solomon
be pursued into the mountains by sex-mad baboons
be whipped with a thousand scorpions
be thrown into a den of hyperactive lions
be swallowed by a whale with excessively bad breath
be smitten with all-over boils
be mocked by eunuchs
be captured by Midianite maniacs
become as popular as a boil on the king's backside
be plagued with gnats, flies and locusts
be taunted by the king's concubines
fall under a speeding chariot
be as welcome as a fart in the queen's bedchamber
accidentally insult Goliath
go about weeping and wailing in sackcloth and ashes
go on a diet of crunchy, unsweetened locusts
be trampled by a herd of stampeding pigs
be cast onto a steaming dung-heap
be turned into a pillar of salt
see your pomegranates wither
beget difficult teenagers
be kicked by an incontinent camel
crash the king's best-loved chariot
