This is a set of files for use with Greg Smith's ``Spew'' program.
Spew is in comp.sources.games Volume 1 and comp.sources.misc Volume
10.  If you don't have a copy of the archives on something like the
Prime Time Freeware CD, it's available for FTP or UUCP from
uunet.uu.net in /usenet/comp.sources.misc/volume10/spew.Z.

Without further adiew, here's what's in this distribution:

	headline	The big one.  Spews gobs of different headlines
			and has room at the top for some local
			customizations.  Lots of fun to run through
			filters like ``jive.''  Some definitions make
			use of tricks like recursion.

	c-code		Spews syntactically-correct C code.  It won't
			compile, but after a run through indent(1)
			it's good for a laugh or two.

	gibberish	Invent a new language!  Amuse your friends!
			Confuse your enemies!

	hawaiian	Similar to gibberish, but spews random text
			using rules based on the Hawaiian language.
			(Checked out by someone	who speaks Hawaiian, I
			might add!)

	talkshow 	What's on Oprah today

	buzzword	A few things to put in your next report to
			management


If you have additions/suggestions/flames/whatever for any of these
files, please feel free to mail them to me at the address below.  I
try to grab a headline or two whenever I'm in the grocery store, so
look for periodic updates.

Enjoy!
