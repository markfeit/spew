		  The Young Person's Guide to "Spew"


"Spew" is a program that randomly generates National Enquirer-style
headlines.

If you're using Spew here at ERA, add the following to your .cshrc:

	setenv RULESFILE /home/mark/src/spew/headlines/headline
	set path=($path /home/mark/bin/sun4)

Now you're set to go.

A quick summary of how to spew:

	spew			Gets you a headline
	spew 28			Gets you 28 headlines
	spew foo		Gets you a headline based on the rules in
				the file `foo.'
	spew 28 foo		Like `spew foo,' only more so.


Enjoy, and please don't take anything you read too seriously.
